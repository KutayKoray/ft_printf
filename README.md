## About
This repository contains my solutions for the **ft_printf** project in 42.

The **ft_printf** project involves implementing a custom version of the printf function, capable of handling various format specifiers like integers, strings, and characters. It focuses on mastering variadic arguments and format parsing. This project enhances skills in handling low-level I/O and provides a deeper understanding of how the standard library functions work.
